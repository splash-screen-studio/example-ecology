```

Each place connects to 2-3 others via the Lifeweave. Players unlock connections by restoring nodes.

## Place 3: The Sunken Forest

### Concept
A lowland forest partially submerged by rising water. Trees grow from the water, creating a half-aquatic, half-terrestrial ecosystem. The flood came gradually, and life adapted — but something is accelerating the water rise.

### Visual Identity
- Trees rising from still, dark water
- Mist hanging between trunks
- Bioluminescent life beneath surface
- Flooded ruins suggesting previous civilization
- Eerie beauty, quiet except for water sounds

### Ecosystem Theme
**Adaptation and Transition**
- Species learning to live in new conditions
- Some thriving, some drowning
- Vertical ecosystem: underwater, water surface, above water, canopy

### Core Problem
Water level is rising faster than species can adapt. Trees are drowning, ground-dwellers are running out of land, fish are invading spaces they shouldn't be.

### The Cause
Connected to Verdant Basin — excess water that should flow to Driftplain is instead flooding Sunken Forest. Fixing Basin/Plain connection will stabilize water level here.

### Key Species
- **Stilted Deer** — Evolved long legs to wade
- **Canopy Monkey** — Never touches water anymore
- **Giant Salamander** — Thriving apex predator
- **Drowning Owl** — Ground-nester struggling to survive
- **Underwater Orchid** — Beautiful, rare, endangered

### Player Activities
- Navigate by boat/swimming
- Create land bridges for trapped animals
- Relocate species vertically
- Find flooded ruins with lore
- Stabilize water level (late game)

### Lifeweave Node
Located in a flooded temple beneath the largest tree. Requires underwater exploration to reach.

---

## Place 4: The Frozen Reach

### Concept
A vast tundra where survival depends on timing. Animals migrate in, survive the brief summer, then leave before winter kills everything. The problem: migration routes are blocked, and some animals are trapped.

### Visual Identity
- Endless white and pale blue
- Short summer with explosion of life
- Northern lights at night
- Ice formations, frozen lakes
- Harsh wind, blowing snow

### Ecosystem Theme
**Cycles and Timing**
- Everything happens in narrow windows
- Miss the window, die
- Interconnection with distant places (migration)

### Core Problem
The passage to warmer lands (connects to Canopy Kingdom) is blocked. Animals that should migrate are stuck. They'll die when winter comes.

### The Cause
Lifeweave node that regulates seasonal passages has failed. The "paths" that open for migration are closed.

### Key Species
- **Tundra Caribou** — Large herds, trapped
- **Arctic Fox** — Predator, doing well (lots of trapped prey)
- **Snow Hare** — Prey species, declining fast
- **Migration Bird** — Some escaped, some didn't
- **Polar Bear-Type** — Apex, will starve when prey runs out

### Player Activities
- Race against time (winter is coming)
- Create temporary shelters
- Find alternative routes
- Reduce predator pressure on trapped herds
- Restore migration node

### Lifeweave Node
Hidden in an ice cave that only appears during certain light conditions. Node controls "passage timing" — when migration routes open.

### Seasonal Mechanic
This place has accelerated time. Player experiences multiple seasons, must learn the rhythm.

## Place 5: The Coral Shallows

### Concept
A coastal reef system where ocean meets land. Tide pools, reefs, shore birds, marine mammals. The reef is bleaching, and the cause is upstream — pollution/sediment from damaged land ecosystems.

### Visual Identity
- Crystal clear water in shallows
- Colorful coral (where healthy)
- White dead coral (where dying)
- Rocky tide pools teeming with life
- Seabirds wheeling overhead

### Ecosystem Theme
**Downstream Consequences**
- What happens on land affects the sea
- Coral is the canary in the coal mine
- Complexity and fragility of reef systems

### Core Problem
Coral is dying. Without coral, fish leave. Without fish, larger predators starve. Without the reef, the coastline erodes.

### The Cause
Sediment and nutrient runoff from damaged upstream ecosystems (connects to multiple land places). Fixing land problems fixes the reef over time.

### Key Species
- **Reef Fish** (many species) — Declining with coral
- **Sea Turtle** — Nesting beaches threatened
- **Shore Crab** — Tide pool survivor
- **Pelican** — Fishing bird, hungry
- **Reef Shark** — Apex, leaving for better waters
- **Cleaner Shrimp** — Key mutualist with fish

### Player Activities
- Underwater exploration (new movement mode)
- Coral restoration (slow, careful)
- Protect nesting beaches
- Track pollution sources upstream
- Manage invasive species

### Lifeweave Node
In an underwater cave behind the largest coral formation. Connects ocean systems to land systems.

### New Mechanic
Tide cycle affects access. High tide: underwater areas accessible. Low tide: tide pools explorable, underwater areas unreachable.

---

## Place 6: The Ashen Caldera

### Concept
A volcanic crater where life is returning after eruption. Extremophile organisms, pioneer species, the process of ecological succession visible in real-time. Theme of destruction and renewal.

### Visual Identity
- Black volcanic rock
- Steam vents, hot springs
- Patches of green reclaiming the black
- Distant volcano, occasionally rumbling
- Harsh beauty, stark contrasts

### Ecosystem Theme
**Succession and Renewal**
- Life returns after catastrophe
- First colonizers prepare ground for later species
- Ecosystems are not static — they're stories

### Core Problem
The natural succession is stalled. Something is preventing the next stage of recovery. The caldera should be further along by now.

### The Cause
Lifeweave energy that powers renewal is being diverted elsewhere. Another ecosystem is "stealing" regeneration energy.

### Key Species
- **Lava Beetle** — Extremophile, thriving
- **Thermal Bacteria** (visible as colored pools)
- **Pioneer Grass** — First plant colonizer
- **Ash Mouse** — Small mammal, barely surviving
- **Fire Bird** — Mythical, only appears when succession advances

### Player Activities
- Encourage succession (plant seeds, create shade)
- Protect pioneer species from threats
- Find and restore energy flow
- Witness transformation over time
- Encounter the Fire Bird (major milestone)

### Lifeweave Node
In the heart of the caldera, near the volcano's throat. Hot, dangerous, requires preparation.

### Unique Element
Time moves differently here. Player can witness succession stages that take decades in real time.

## Place 7: The Canopy Kingdom

### Concept
A towering rainforest where life exists in vertical layers. Ground level is dark and sparse; canopy is a world unto itself. Species never touch the ground. Theme of layered ecosystems, hidden complexity.

### Visual Identity
- Massive trees, ground barely visible
- Dappled light through leaves
- Vines, epiphytes, hanging gardens
- Color explosion in canopy
- Mist, rain, humidity

### Ecosystem Theme
**Vertical Stratification**
- Ground, understory, canopy, emergent — each a different world
- Species occupy specific layers
- Connections between layers are critical

### Core Problem
The connections between layers are breaking. Canopy species can't reach ground resources. Ground species can't access canopy. The forest is fragmenting vertically.

### The Cause
Lifeweave "vertical" connections have failed. The invisible paths species used between layers are gone.

### Key Species
- **Canopy Sloth** — Never descends, stuck above
- **Forest Floor Pig** — Needs fallen fruit, not getting it
- **Layer Monkey** — Used to travel all layers, now trapped in middle
- **Harpy Eagle** — Apex, hunts between layers
- **Pollinator Hummingbird** — Critical for flower reproduction
- **Strangler Fig** — Keystone plant, connects all layers

### Player Activities
- Learn to navigate vertically (climbing mechanics)
- Build bridges/paths between layers
- Relocate species to appropriate layers
- Restore pollination routes
- Find the Strangler Fig that connects everything

### Lifeweave Node
At the very top of the tallest emergent tree. Requires full vertical mastery to reach.

## Place 8: The Underground

### Concept
A vast cave system beneath all other places. The Lifeweave's physical infrastructure is here — ancient mechanisms, glowing roots, the literal connections between places. This is where understanding crystallizes.

### Visual Identity
- Bioluminescent everything
- Massive caverns, impossible architecture
- Lifeweave visible as glowing network
- Ancient, otherworldly, humbling
- Beautiful and terrifying

### Ecosystem Theme
**The Hidden Foundation**
- What's beneath supports what's above
- Invisible systems make visible life possible
- The Lifeweave is not just metaphor

### Core Problem
The central hub of the Lifeweave is damaged. This is WHY all the surface problems exist. The source of all imbalance.

### The Cause
Revealed here: [MAJOR STORY SPOILER — to be determined, but suggestions:]
- Natural decay of ancient system requiring renewal
- Intentional sabotage by previous civilization
- Player's own actions have been misguided
- The Lifeweave is a living thing, and it's sick

### Key Species
- **Cave Crawler** — Blind, navigates by feel
- **Glow Worm** — Living light source
- **The Ancient** — Massive, ancient creature, possibly intelligent
- **Lifeweave Tender** — Small creatures that maintain the network
- **Echo Bat** — Sonar, guides player

### Player Activities
- Navigate by glow (no regular light)
- Learn the Lifeweave's structure
- Make critical choice about restoration
- Encounter The Ancient (pivotal story moment)
- Open path to The Source

### Lifeweave Node
The Central Hub — the heart of the entire network. Restoring it is the climax of the game's main arc.

## Place 9: The Source

### Concept
The high mountains where all water originates. Glaciers, alpine meadows, thin air. The beginning of everything — and potentially where the player can reshape the future of the world.

### Visual Identity
- Snow-capped peaks
- Glacial lakes, crystal clear
- Alpine flowers in brief summer
- Thin atmosphere, visible stars even in day
- Sacred, ancient, endpoint

### Ecosystem Theme
**Origin and Choice**
- All water starts here
- What happens here affects everything below
- Player's final choice shapes the world

### Core Problem
The Source is fine — it's been protected. But the player must decide: how should the Lifeweave be restored? Options with consequences.

### Final Choice Examples
1. **Full Restoration** — Return to ancient balance (best for ecosystems, but...)
2. **Adaptive Restoration** — Let ecosystems find new balance (uncertain outcome)
3. **Player-Guided** — Player chooses which connections to prioritize
4. **Let it Fail** — Sometimes systems need to collapse to truly renew

### Key Species
- **Mountain Ibex** — Hardy, wise
- **Golden Eagle** — Watches over all
- **Pika** — Small mammal, indicator of alpine health
- **Ghost Orchid** — Rarest plant, blooms once per decade
- **The Watcher** — Ancient being, asks the final question

### Player Activities
- Pilgrimage to the peak
- Reflect on all that was learned
- Make the final choice
- Witness the consequences (ending cinematic)

### Lifeweave Node
The First Node — where it all began. Player can restore, reshape, or release the Lifeweave.

## Expansion Philosophy

### How to Add Places

Each new place should:
1. Have a **unique ecosystem** with distinct visual identity
2. Present a **local problem** that's actually a symptom
3. **Connect to existing places** in the Lifeweave
4. Introduce **new species** and **new mechanics**
5. Reveal **more of the story**
6. Be **playable independently** but enriched by connections

### Suggested Release Order

1. **Launch**: Verdant Basin + Driftplain
2. **Update 1**: The Sunken Forest (connects to Basin)
3. **Update 2**: The Frozen Reach (connects to Plain)
4. **Update 3**: The Coral Shallows (downstream of all)
5. **Update 4**: The Ashen Caldera (standalone, but connected)
6. **Update 5**: The Canopy Kingdom (vertical gameplay)
7. **Update 6**: The Underground (story revelation)
8. **Final Update**: The Source (conclusion)

### Community Expansion Potential

After main story:
- Player-created biomes?
- Procedural micro-ecosystems?
- Seasonal events that affect all places?
- Multiplayer cooperation to solve cross-place problems?
