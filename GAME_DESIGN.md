# Verdant Basin — Game Design Document

This document defines the actual game: story, mechanics, progression, and content.

## What Makes This a Game

An **experience** is something you witness. A **game** has:

1. **Goals** — Clear objectives the player works toward
2. **Agency** — Player choices that matter
3. **Progression** — Growth, unlocks, expanding capability
4. **Stakes** — Consequences for success and failure
5. **Mastery** — Skills that improve with practice
6. **Mystery** — Questions that drive exploration

---

## The Core Concept

**You are an Ecologist.**

Not a warrior, not a builder, not a collector. You are someone who *understands* ecosystems and can *influence* them. Your tools are observation, patience, and small interventions that create large ripples.

**The world is alive** — with or without you. Animals hunt, eat, breed, migrate, and die. Plants grow, spread, and wither. Weather changes. Seasons turn. You are not the center of this world. You are a visitor who can choose to help, harm, or simply watch.

**Something is wrong.** The ecosystems are out of balance. Species are disappearing. Water is drying up. Predators are starving. The causes are not obvious. Your job is to discover what's happening and decide what to do about it.

---

## The Central Mystery

### The Premise

Long ago, the world's ecosystems were connected by the **Lifeweave** — an invisible network that kept everything in balance. Water flowed where it was needed. Animal populations self-regulated. Droughts in one region were offset by abundance in another.

The Lifeweave is **failing**.

Each place you visit shows symptoms of this failure. Your journey is to:
1. Understand what each ecosystem needs
2. Discover how the places are connected
3. Find the source of the imbalance
4. Choose how to restore (or reshape) the Lifeweave

### The Mystery Unfolds

**Act 1: Learning (Verdant Basin)**
- Player learns basic ecology mechanics
- Discovers something is "off" — overpopulation, species missing
- Finds first clue: an ancient marker pointing to Driftplain
- Realizes the two places are connected

**Act 2: Contrast (Driftplain)**
- Opposite ecosystem, same underlying problem
- What's abundant in Basin is scarce here
- Discovery: resources that should flow between places are blocked
- First glimpse of the larger network

**Act 3: Expansion (Future Places)**
- Each new place reveals another piece of the puzzle
- Pattern emerges: all ecosystems were once balanced
- Player begins actively restoring connections
- Choices accumulate — player's approach matters

**Act 4: Revelation**
- Source of the imbalance revealed
- Player must make meaningful choice about how to restore the world
- Multiple endings based on accumulated decisions

## Core Gameplay Loop

```
OBSERVE → UNDERSTAND → INTERVENE → WITNESS CONSEQUENCES
    ↑                                        |
    └────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Observe
- Watch animal behavior patterns
- Notice what's thriving, what's struggling
- Track changes over time (in-game days)
- Find environmental clues

### Understand
- Identify cause-and-effect relationships
- Learn food chains, water dependencies
- Discover what each species needs
- Recognize when something is wrong

### Intervene
- Plant seeds, clear blockages, redirect water
- Relocate animals (carefully!)
- Introduce or remove species
- Activate ancient mechanisms

### Witness Consequences
- Changes ripple through ecosystem over time
- Some interventions help, some hurt
- Unintended consequences are real
- Learn from outcomes, adjust approach

---

## Player Role: The Ecologist

### What You Can Do

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Plant seeds** | Grow vegetation (slowly) |
| **Clear debris** | Open water flow, paths |
| **Place food** | Attract animals to areas |
| **Relocate animals** | Move small creatures (risky) |
| **Build shelters** | Create safe zones for species |
| **Activate nodes** | Restore Lifeweave connections |

### What You Cannot Do

- Kill animals directly (you're an ecologist, not a hunter)
- Build permanent structures (you're a visitor)
- Instantly fix problems (ecosystems take time)
- Control weather (you observe, not command)

### Tools

1. **Field Journal** — Records observations, tracks species, notes patterns
2. **Seed Pouch** — Collected seeds from plants you've found
3. **Sample Kit** — Collect water/soil samples to analyze
4. **Attunement Stone** — Sense nearby Lifeweave nodes
5. **Lure Whistle** — Attract specific species (once you learn their call)

---

## Progression Systems

### Knowledge Progression

**Species Codex**
- Each animal/plant has an entry
- Starts blank, fills in through observation
- Complete entries unlock abilities (call species, predict behavior)
- Progress: 0% → 25% (basic info) → 50% (diet/habitat) → 75% (behavior) → 100% (mastery)

**Ecosystem Understanding**
- Each place has hidden "rules"
- Discover through experimentation
- Example: "In Verdant Basin, fish population affects bird population"
- Unlocks: predictions, efficient interventions

### Capability Progression

**Not XP/Levels** — knowledge is power

| You Learn | You Can Now Do |
|-----------|----------------|
| A plant's seed location | Collect and plant it elsewhere |
| An animal's food preference | Lure it with bait |
| A water source's origin | Trace it to redirect |
| A Lifeweave node's location | Attempt to activate it |
| A species' mating behavior | Create conditions for breeding |

### World Progression

**Ecosystem Health** (per place)
- Tracked silently (no progress bar)
- Visible through environmental cues
- Improves/degrades based on player actions AND time
- Thresholds unlock new areas, species, story beats

**Lifeweave Restoration**
- Activating nodes connects places
- Connections create new possibilities
- Fully restored connections = major story milestone

## The Two Starting Places

# VERDANT BASIN (Detailed)

## Overview

A dense, lowland wetland ecosystem where everything is connected by water. Life thrives here — perhaps too much. The problem is not scarcity but **overcrowding and imbalance**.

## The Hook

When you arrive, Verdant Basin seems like paradise. Lush vegetation, abundant wildlife, flowing water. But within the first in-game day, you notice:

- Certain plants are overrunning others
- One species of fish dominates the streams
- Birds are aggressive, competing for limited nesting sites
- A predator species is conspicuously absent

**The Question**: What happened to the apex predator, and what happens to an ecosystem without one?

## Geography

```
                    [Ancient Tree - Story Hub]
                           |
        [Mushroom Grove]---+---[Waterfall Vista]
              |                      |

        [Cave Mouth]---[Outflow]---[Basin Exit → Driftplain]
```

### Key Locations

**Central Lake**
- Heart of the ecosystem
- All water flows from here
- Overpopulated with one fish species
- Player's first major puzzle: why?

**Ancient Tree**
- Massive tree on island in lake
- Contains NPC: The Keeper (spirit/old ecologist)
- Story hub, cryptic guidance
- First Lifeweave node location

**Mushroom Grove**
- Dark, damp forest section
- Decomposers, insects, small mammals
- Important for nutrient cycling
- Hidden: rare night-blooming plant

**Waterfall Vista**
- High point, overlooks basin
- Reward for exploration
- Clue: water comes from distant mountains
- Visible: path to Driftplain

**Frog Marsh**
- Amphibian breeding ground
- Currently healthy, keystone species
- Indicator: if frogs decline, ecosystem is in trouble
- Player learns observation here

**Heron Rookery**
- Bird nesting area (currently overcrowded)
- Competition is fierce, nests failing
- Problem: too many herons, not enough fish diversity
- Intervention opportunity

**Reed Maze**
- Navigational puzzle
- Hides small creatures
- Path changes with water level
- Contains water flow mechanism

**Cave Mouth**
- Dark, mysterious entrance
- Leads underground to Lifeweave hub
- Unlocks in Act 2 after restoring first node
- Foreshadows larger world

**Basin Exit**
- River flows out toward Driftplain
- Currently blocked/reduced (core problem)
- Restoring this is major milestone
- Connects the two starting places

## Species

### Fauna

| Species | Role | Status | Notes |
|---------|------|--------|-------|
| **Basin Trout** | Primary fish | Overpopulated | Outcompeting other fish |
| **Spotted Minnow** | Small fish | Declining | Trout eating their food |
| **Great Heron** | Fish predator | Overpopulated | Too many, competing |
| **Marsh Frog** | Amphibian | Healthy | Indicator species |
| **Water Vole** | Small mammal | Declining | Habitat squeezed |
| **Snapping Turtle** | Omnivore | Rare | Key to balance |
| **River Otter** | Apex predator | **MISSING** | Core mystery |

### Flora

| Species | Role | Status | Notes |
|---------|------|--------|-------|
| **Lily Pad** | Water plant | Abundant | Provides cover |
| **Reed Grass** | Bank plant | Spreading | Crowding others |
| **Sunfruit Bush** | Berry plant | Common | Food for birds/mammals |
| **Moonpetal** | Rare flower | Very rare | Blooms at night |
| **Ancient Oak** | Canopy tree | Stable | Nesting sites |
| **Strangler Vine** | Invasive | Spreading | Problem plant |

## The Core Problem

**The River Otter is gone.**

Without the apex predator:
- Trout population exploded (no predator)
- Trout outcompete minnows (minnows decline)
- Herons multiply (abundant trout)
- Herons overcrowd rookery (competition)
- Heron aggression increases (nests fail)
- Dead herons wash downstream (disease risk)

**The Cause**: Water flow to Driftplain was reduced. Otters migrated to find water. They never came back.

**The Solution**: Restore water flow. But that requires understanding why it stopped — which leads to Driftplain.

## Quests/Objectives

### Main Quest: "The Missing Otter"

1. **Observe the Imbalance** — Notice fish overpopulation
2. **Consult the Keeper** — Learn about the otter's role
3. **Find Otter Signs** — Track where they went (leads to basin exit)
4. **Discover the Blockage** — River to Driftplain is reduced
5. **Clear the Path** — Requires understanding from Driftplain
6. → Continues in Driftplain

### Side Objectives

- **The Crowded Rookery** — Help herons by improving fish diversity
- **Frog Watch** — Monitor frogs as ecosystem health indicator
- **Strangler Problem** — Clear invasive vines from ancient trees
- **Night Bloom** — Find the rare Moonpetal (requires patience)
- **Turtle Wisdom** — Locate the old snapping turtle (has lore)

## Environmental Storytelling

**What Players Find:**

- Otter den, abandoned but with signs of past habitation
- Scratch marks on trees where otters used to play
- Old fishing spots with otter bones nearby (natural death, old)
- Keeper's memories of when otters were here
- Other animals' behavior that suggests they "remember" otters

**What This Teaches:**

- Ecosystems have memory
- Removing one species affects everything
- Balance is fragile
- Restoration is possible but takes understanding

# DRIFTPLAIN (Detailed)

## Overview

A vast, arid grassland where water is scarce and resources migrate with the seasons. Life here is about adaptation, movement, and patience. The problem is not overcrowding but **disconnection and isolation**.

## The Hook

Arriving from Verdant Basin, the contrast is stark. Where Basin had too much, Driftplain has too little. But you notice:

- Water holes are drying up faster than they should
- Herds are fragmented, not moving as one
- Predators are hunting near exhaustion
- Ancient migration paths are blocked

**The Question**: Why has the water stopped coming, and what happened to the great herds?

## Geography

```
    [Mountain Pass - Future Exit]
              |
    [Canyon Maze]---[Spire Summit]
         |               |
    [Salt Flat]---[Central Plain]---[Bone Hollow]
         |               |               |
    [Dried Lake]---[Last Oasis]---[Predator Den]
         |               |               |
    [Basin Inlet]---[Grazing Fields]---[Migration Route]
         ↓
   [To Verdant Basin]
```

### Key Locations

**Central Plain**
- Vast open area, main grazing ground
- Herds visible in distance
- Wind is constant, shapes everything
- Player feels small here

**The Spire**
- Monolithic rock formation (from marketing art)
- Visible from everywhere
- Contains second Lifeweave node
- Climb reveals the whole region

**Last Oasis**
- Only reliable water source
- Overcrowded with desperate animals
- Tension between species
- Key intervention point

**Dried Lake**
- Was once a major lake
- Now cracked earth, bones
- Environmental storytelling: what happened?
- Answer: water from Basin stopped flowing here

**Bone Hollow**
- Graveyard of animals
- Some died of thirst, some of age
- Scavenger birds circle constantly
- Contains lore: old migration stories

**Salt Flat**
- Blinding white expanse
- Dangerous to cross without preparation
- Hides ancient mechanisms beneath
- Lifeweave infrastructure revealed

**Canyon Maze**
- Sheltered from wind
- Contains hidden water (underground)
- Safe haven for small animals
- Path to future regions

**Predator Den**
- Home of the Lion-Cat (apex predator)
- They're starving, herds too dispersed
- Could attack player if desperate
- Solving water crisis helps them too

**Basin Inlet**
- Where water from Verdant Basin SHOULD arrive
- Currently a trickle
- Blockage is on Basin side
- Restoring this is major milestone

## Species

### Fauna

| Species | Role | Status | Notes |
|---------|------|--------|-------|
| **Plains Grazer** | Herd herbivore | Fragmented | Should be in larger groups |
| **Dust Hare** | Small herbivore | Stable | Adapted to scarcity |
| **Spiral Antelope** | Large herbivore | Declining | Thirsty, weak |
| **Lion-Cat** | Apex predator | Starving | Herds too scattered |
| **Bone Vulture** | Scavenger | Thriving | Too much death |
| **Sand Burrower** | Underground mammal | Hidden | Knows water locations |
| **Wind Hawk** | Raptor | Rare | Long-distance sight |

### Flora

| Species | Role | Status | Notes |
|---------|------|--------|-------|
| **Spike Grass** | Dominant grass | Stable | Tough, sparse |
| **Oasis Palm** | Water indicator | Rare | Only at water sources |
| **Thorn Bush** | Defense plant | Common | Animals avoid |
| **Night Cactus** | Water storage | Common | Player can drink (emergency) |
| **Bone Root** | Deep-water plant | Rare | Signals underground water |

## The Core Problem

**The herds are scattered because the water is scattered.**

Without consistent water flow from Basin:
- Water holes dry up unpredictably
- Herds fragment to find water
- Migration routes break
- Predators can't follow herds (too spread out)
- Predators starve, then attack anything (including player)
- Whole ecosystem in death spiral

**The Cause**: Something blocked the water flow between Basin and Plain. The water that should nourish Driftplain is backing up in Basin (causing Basin's problems too).

**The Solution**: Restore the connection. This requires understanding BOTH ecosystems and finding the blockage — which is physical AND related to the Lifeweave.

## Quests/Objectives

### Main Quest: "The Scattered Herds"

1. **Witness the Thirst** — See animals at overcrowded oasis
2. **Find the Sand Burrower** — Learn of underground water
3. **Trace the Missing River** — Follow dry riverbed to inlet
4. **Discover the Connection** — Realize water comes from Basin
5. **Restore the Flow** — Requires work in BOTH places
6. → Major milestone: water flows again

### Side Objectives

- **Lion-Cat Truce** — Prove you're not prey (requires understanding their desperation)
- **Migration Memory** — Find old markers showing historical routes
- **Underground Water** — Locate hidden water to help immediate crisis
- **The Spire's Secret** — Climb to activate Lifeweave node
- **Bone Reading** — Learn from the dead what the region was like before

## Environmental Storytelling

**What Players Find:**

- Dry riverbed with fish skeletons (river used to flow)
- Old water lines on rocks (lake was higher)
- Antelope bones along migration route (couldn't finish journey)
- Cave paintings showing abundant water, connected lands
- Lifeweave markers half-buried in sand

**What This Teaches:**

- Places are connected in invisible ways
- Scarcity in one place can stem from abundance mismanaged elsewhere
- Ecosystems have history
- Restoration requires seeing the whole picture

---

## The Connection

### What Players Discover

Verdant Basin and Driftplain are two ends of the same system:

```
[Mountain Source]
       ↓
[Verdant Basin] ←→ [Underground Lifeweave] ←→ [Driftplain]
       ↓                                            ↓
[Overflow to sea]                           [Evaporation cycle]
```

The water that fills Basin should flow through to Plain. The Lifeweave regulated this — sending water where it was needed, keeping both in balance.

**The Blockage**: A Lifeweave node between them has failed. Water backs up in Basin (too much), doesn't reach Plain (too little).

**The Restoration**: Player must:
1. Find the blocked node (in the caves between places)
2. Understand what broke it (story revelation)
3. Restore it (gameplay challenge)
4. Witness both ecosystems rebalance

### The Bigger Picture

This connection is just ONE strand of the Lifeweave. The world has many ecosystems, all connected. The pattern repeats:
- Each place has a local problem
- Each problem stems from a broken connection
- Restoring connections reveals the larger network
- Eventually: find why the whole Lifeweave is failing

---

## Themes

### Primary Themes

**Interconnection**
- Everything is connected
- Actions have consequences beyond the immediate
- You cannot fix one place without understanding its connections

**Balance**
- Ecosystems are not about maximizing one thing
- Too much is as harmful as too little
- Balance requires active maintenance

**Patience**
- Real change takes time
- Observation before action
- Quick fixes often backfire

**Responsibility**
- With understanding comes obligation
- You can help or harm
- Inaction is also a choice

### Tone

- **Wonder** — The world is beautiful and complex
- **Melancholy** — Things are broken, loss is real
- **Hope** — Restoration is possible
- **Mystery** — Questions drive exploration
- **Humility** — You are small in a vast world

---

## What Makes It Replayable

1. **Multiple Solutions** — Problems can be solved different ways with different consequences
2. **Ecosystem Simulation** — World keeps changing, new situations emerge
3. **Mastery Curve** — Deeper understanding enables better interventions
4. **Seasonal Cycles** — Ecosystems change with time, new challenges each season
5. **Story Choices** — Decisions accumulate toward different endings
6. **Discovery** — Hidden species, locations, lore to find
7. **Expansion** — New places add new challenges, connect to existing ones

---

## Future Places (Outline)

See [FUTURE_PLACES.md](./FUTURE_PLACES.md) for detailed outlines of:

1. **The Sunken Forest** — Flooded woodland, aquatic/terrestrial blend
2. **The Frozen Reach** — Tundra, migration/hibernation focus
3. **The Coral Shallows** — Coastal reef, ocean/land interface
4. **The Ashen Caldera** — Volcanic, extremophile life, rebirth theme
5. **The Canopy Kingdom** — Rainforest, vertical ecosystem
6. **The Underground** — Cave system, Lifeweave hub, revelation zone
7. **The Source** — Mountains where all water originates, climax location

Each place:
- Has unique ecosystem with local problem
- Connects to at least two other places
- Contains Lifeweave nodes
- Reveals piece of larger story
- Introduces new species, mechanics, challenges
