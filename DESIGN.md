# Verdant Basin

An ecology simulation with two contrasting biomes.

## Places

### Verdant Basin
A dense, lowland ecosystem where water, plant growth, and animal populations are tightly interconnected. Small changes quickly ripple through the system.

**Visual style:**
- Lush, vibrant greens with soft sunlight
- Winding rivers, waterfalls, wetland deltas
- Dense vegetation, reeds, lily pads
- Teeming with life
- Interconnected, fertile, abundant

### Driftplain
A harsh, open region shaped by wind and scarcity. Resources migrate over time and survival depends on adapting to constant environmental change.

**Visual style:**
- Muted sepia/tan palette, hazy overcast sky
- Vast empty expanses with sparse dry grass
- Lone monolithic spire landmark
- Scattered rocks, small precious water pools
- Harsh, solitary, survival-focused

## Art Direction
- Contemplative, artistic style
- Isometric or top-down view for gameplay
- Strong environmental contrast between abundance and scarcity
